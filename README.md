# GO-CRUD

Simple CRUD operations API in GO using GIN and GORM.

## CRUD Stands For

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

## GORM And GIN

### What Is GORM?

GORM is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Golang. It provides a developer-friendly way to interact with databases by abstracting away the complexity of direct SQL queries. Instead, developers can work with Go structs to perform database operations, making the code more readable, maintainable, and secure.

### Why Use GORM?

- **Simplifies Database Operations**: Abstracts SQL queries for easier, more readable code.
- **Auto Migrations**: Automatically manages schema changes.
- **Associations**: Handles relationships like one-to-many and many-to-many.
- **Hooks**: Lifecycle hooks for actions before/after create, update, delete.
- **Eager Loading**: Fetch related data efficiently.
- **Query Building**: Powerful, flexible query builder.
- **Community**: Active support and extensive documentation.

### Alternatives To GORM

1. **SQLBoiler**: Strong type safety, generates code from schema, but complex setup.
2. **Ent (Entgo.io)**: Type-safe, schema management in Go, steep learning curve.
3. **Beego ORM**: Integrated with Beego framework, simpler, fewer features.
4. **Xorm**: Lightweight, good for small projects, limited advanced features.
5. **Raw SQL with `database/sql`**: Maximum control, more boilerplate, error-prone.

### GORM Advantages

- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive API.
- **Feature-Rich**: Comprehensive features for web applications.
- **Community and Documentation**: Extensive support and resources.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for simple and complex use cases.
- **Mature and Stable**: Well-tested, fewer bugs.

### What Is GIN?

Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework written in Go (Golang). It is designed for building APIs and web services, offering simplicity and speed.

### Why Use Gin?

- **Performance**: Extremely fast HTTP router due to a tree-based structure.
- **Middleware**: Easy to write and use middleware for logging, authentication, etc.
- **Routing**: Powerful and flexible routing with groups and nested groups.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error management.
- **JSON Handling**: Efficient JSON handling and rendering.
- **Community**: Large, active community with extensive documentation.

### Alternatives To Gin

1. **Echo**: High performance, middleware support, but slightly more complex.
2. **Fiber**: Inspired by Express.js, very fast, but newer with a smaller community.
3. **Beego**: Integrated web framework, easier for full-stack development, but heavier.
4. **Chi**: Lightweight, idiomatic Go, good for smaller applications.
5. **Revel**: Full-featured web framework, but less popular and slower.

### Gin Advantages

- **Speed**: One of the fastest routers.
- **Simplicity**: Intuitive and easy-to-use API.
- **Middleware Support**: Extensive middleware capabilities.
- **Error Management**: Convenient error handling.
- **Community and Documentation**: Strong support and resources.
